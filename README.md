Last Tagger
===========

The Last Tagger is a Last.fm-backed album tagger.

This only writes a subset of the possible tags (album, artist, album
artist, track number and their corresponding mbid tags). Use it to
prepare an already-tagged collection to use with Last.fm-backed
software.

Dependencies
------------

* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt)
* [Mutagen](http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/)

If you can install these dependencies, then you can run Last Tagger.

Last Tagger will support the same audio file formats that your Mutagen
installation supports. On most installations, that's *every* format.

Instructions
------------

You can tag one directory at a time.

1. Select a music directory
2. Enter the name of the album
3. Click "search"
4. Choose the album from the dialog box
5. Choose "Write Tags"
